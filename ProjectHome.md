School project

Grade 12 - Group project

Visual Basic 6.0

This was a project assigned to everybody in the class for creating a pizza company software suite. We were in groups of three for this one. My group ended up working very well together: we divided up various areas of code and design, and we completed our tasks timely.

My job was to design and code the cashier program. We were given a list of different kinds of pizza, toppings, sizes, drinks, combos and prices, and they all had to be implemented correctly. I also implemented a receipt archiving system, where the user can save orders, come back to past orders at any time, and submit orders to a warehouse application that was coded by another member of the team. The warehouse program would keep track of the orders from the cashier program and offer various statistics, as well as manage the prices and names of all the products.

I'm uploading the entire project, but I did not code every aspect of it. The rest of my group was mainly responsible for the warehouse program and project overhead. My contribution was mainly in the cashier program.
